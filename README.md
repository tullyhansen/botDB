# botDB

This is my Twitter bot cataloguing project. There are many like it, but this one is mineâ€”and yours, too, if you want! See _How to Contribute_ below.

Built with [Exhibit][], pulling data from [a Google Sheet][].

## TODO

- Better linking to Twitter profiles using Exhibit's `data-ex-href-subcontent`
- Figure out the relational (?) database part

[Exhibit]: http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/
[a Google Sheet]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vleb6Y37ctkjlWbCiTemABgpit83eqW1FT8HEwc0l9I/

# botally-toolkit

A chaotic good bunch of Python scripts for collecting data about Twitter bot accounts.

## How to use

Seeing as I just spent the best part of an hour figuring out how to run these scripts again after re-downloading the Github file

- 

You'll need to make a file in the root folder called .env and it should look like this (except with your app's keys and tokens in the quotation marks):

	# some env variables

	TWITTER_API_KEY="yourAPIkeyappearslikethis"
	TWITTER_API_SECRET="itisimportantthatyoutrynottocommityourkeystoGitHub"
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="11111111-donotgiveyourTwittertokensawaytostrangers"
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="payheedanounceofpreventionisworthapoundofcure"

## Todo

Fix up this
