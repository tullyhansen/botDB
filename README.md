# botDB

This is my Twitter **bot** **d**ata**b**ase. There are many like it, but this one is mine—and [yours too](#how-to-contribute), if you want!

[botDB](.) is a good-natured. It has four main sections:

- [bots](bots/), a directory of Twitter bot accounts
- [botALLY](botALLY/), for their human creators and compatriots
- [botMEDIA](botMEDIA/), links to writing, talks, and news coverage on bots
- [botMATERIALS](botMATERIALS/), APIs, datasets and code

Each section can be browsed, searched and filtered in various ways. [botDB](.) is intended as a central repository to capture much of the around Twitter bot scene

## How it works 

[botDB](.) is put together using the following:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)) for static website hosting
- Mark Otto's [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), for making said site much prettier
- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) and [Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) to collect, store and serve data
- [Exhibit 3.0](http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/), 'a publishing framework for… data-rich interactive Web pages', is used for data display and visualisation 

## How to contribute

The simplest and most helpful thing is to add more entries to the database!

Right now there's no way to edit or delete existing entries yourself. If you need to do so, you can [get in touch](#feedback-and-support).

At this point in time the Google Sheets are not directly editable by the public; this may change in future.

If you'd like to make improvements to the site itself, and you have a Github account, you're welcome to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) botDB – you'll need Jekyll installed if you want to run the site locally.

## Feedback and support
