# botDB

This is my Twitter **bot** **d**ata**b**ase. There are [many](http://twitter.pbworks.com/w/page/1779741/Bots) [like](http://bothub.org) [it](https://botwiki.org), but this one is mine—and [yours too](#how-to-contribute), if you want!

[botDB](.) aims to be a friendly, easy-to-use website for showcasing Twitter bots—autonomous, automated accounts [of](https://twitter.com/metaphorminute) [all](https://twitter.com/but_if_you_can) [kinds](https://twitter.com/ClearCongress)—and the work of the creative, curious community of people developing alongside them. It has four main sections, each of which can be browsed, searched and filtered in various ways:

- [bots](bots/), a directory of Twitter bot accounts
- [botALLY](botALLY/), for their human creators and compatriots
- [botMEDIA](botMEDIA/), links to writing, talks, and news coverage on bots
- [botMATERIALS](botMATERIALS/), for APIs, datasets, code and other bits for making bots

## How it works 

[botDB](.) is put together using the following:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)) for static website hosting
- Mark Otto's [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), for making said site much prettier
- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) and [Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) to collect, store and serve data
- [Exhibit 3.0](http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/), 'a publishing framework for… data-rich interactive Web pages', for data display and visualisation
- various other code snippets and suggestions, attributed where they appear in source
- lots of Googling

## How to contribute

**This site is presently very much ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️ and doesn't quite yet work  as intended. Once it does, the following will apply, but for now hang tight, or [get in touch](#feedback-and-support)!**

The simplest and most helpful thing is to **add entries to the database**! But be sure to read up on [how to behave](#how-to-behave) first. You're encouraged to submit entries for yourself and your own bots, writing and tools, as well as for the work of others that you admire. This can be done using the Google Forms embedded at the top of each section, which effectively publish 'live' to the site. You're also encouraged (though not required) to sign your name (or alias, Twitter handle, etc.) to your submissions.

If you'd like to **make improvements to the site** itself, and you have a Github account, you're welcome to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the [botDB repo](https://github.com/tullyhansen/botDB/) – you'll [need Jekyll installed](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) if you want to run the site locally. Pull requests welcomed!

## How to behave

[botDB](.) is built in a spirit of curiosity, generosity and respect, and trusts the people (and bots) using and contributing to the database to enter into the same. It most definitely is not intended as a 'bot(maker) doxxing database' or tool of harassment—though it may seem harmless to guess at or dig up attribution on anonymously authored works (and [this is debatable](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.single.html) at best), we **strongly** encourage you to stick to readily available public information, such as attribution within bot bios, public Twitter lists, botmaker blog posts and so on.

Similarly, [botDB](.) respects the right of anyone listed or affected by a listing to request changes, or to opt out completely. The Google Sheets powering the site are not publicly editable, so right now there's no way to edit or delete existing entries yourself—but if you need, please [get in touch](#feedback-and-support) and we'll help as soon as we can. Though we hope not to have to, we reserve utterly the right to edit or remove entries as we see fit, for any reason.

## Licensing

Licensing is confusing as heck! It is hoped that [botDB](.) becomes an interesting and useful resource in its own right, but also one that can freely be incorporated into other projects. With this aim in mind:

- the [botDB](.) website (and associated Github code repository) is licensed under the MIT License
- elements of the [botDB](.) website and code fall under the licenses assigned by their respective creators, as described in the [full license](license/)
- the [botDB](.) database (collected by and stored in Google Docs) is made available under the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)
- any rights in individual contents of the database are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

Copyright in submissions made to the Google Docs comprising the [botDB](.) database remains with their respective contributors, but is considered to be licensed for use in accordance with [CC BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), kinda like what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights) does? I hope that's right.

For further details, see the [full license](license/).
