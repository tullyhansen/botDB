# botDB

[botDB](.) is a Twitter **bot** **d**ata**b**ase in two parts: a friendly, easy-to-use static website on the front end and a user-generated, lightly moderated, Google-Docs-driven database on the back end. It aims to catalogue both the diversity of Twitter bots—autonomous, automated accounts [of](https://twitter.com/metaphorminute) [all](https://twitter.com/but_if_you_can) [kinds](https://twitter.com/ClearCongress)—and the work of the creative, curious community of people developing alongside them.

[botDB](.) has four main sections, each of which can be browsed, searched and filtered in various ways:

- [bots](bots/), a directory of Twitter bot accounts
- [botALLY](botALLY/), for info on their human creators and compatriots
- [botMEDIA](botMEDIA/), links to writing, talks, and news coverage on bots
- [botMATERIALS](botMATERIALS/), for APIs, datasets, code and other botmaking bits

Read on to find out [how it works](#how-it-works), [how to behave](#how-to-behave), [how to contribute](#how-to-contribute) and [how to get in touch](#who-to-complain-to). You'll also find [info on licensing](#licensing) and [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements). If you read nothing else, **[please read this bit](#how-to-behave).**

## How it works 

[botDB](.) is put together using the following:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (running on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)) for static website hosting
- Mark Otto's [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), for making said site much prettier
- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) and [Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/) to collect, store and serve data
- [Exhibit 3.0](http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/), 'a publishing framework for… data-rich interactive Web pages', for data display and visualisation
- various other code snippets and suggestions, attributed where they appear in source
- lots of Googling

[botDB](.) is _user-generated_ in that anyone may submit entries to the database without needing to sign up, log in or otherwise verify their identity; it is _lightly moderated_ in the sense that new entries are opted into the database by default, but [the maintainers of botDB](#who-to-complain-to) reserve the right to edit or remove any entry, for any reason, at their discretion.

## How to behave

**[botDB](.) comes from a place of generosity, curiosity and respect towards bots and their makers**, and [the maintainers of botDB](#who-to-complain-to) trust users and contributors to do the same. The following guidelines are to keep the database useful, usable and safe for everyone, and are subject to change in line with this guiding principle. If they are anywhere unclear, insufficiently detailed or otherwise lacking, please [let us know](#who-to-complain-to)!

**[botDB](.) most emphatically is not a 'bot(maker) doxxing database' or tool of harassment**, Harassment in any form, including but not limited to offensive comments relating to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration status, religion, or other identity markers, will not be tolerated, and will be removed [by the maintainers](#who-to-complain-to) at the earliest opportunity.

[The maintainers of botDB](#who-to-complain-to) uphold the right of everyone in [botDB](.) (contributor or not) to assert the name (or alias) and pronouns by which they be addressed, and will make every effort to ensure these are used accordingly throughout. Similarly, [we](#who-to-complain-to) uphold the right of everyone (contributor or not) to request changes to any entry with which they are not completely comfortable, and for any such changes to be negotiated and put into place in a timely way.

Though it may seem harmless, even fun to speculate on or investigate anonymous or pseudonymous authors and works ([arguable, at best](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.single.html)), [we](#who-to-complain-to) neither encourage nor condone such behaviour, and we suggest in the strongest terms that **all data submitted should be sourced from readily available public materials**: public Twitter lists, botmaker blog posts, attribution in bot bios and so on. Further to this, any  

Finally, given [botDB](.) may contain information on people who have not explicitly consented to appear in the database, **anyone may opt themselves and/or any or all of their work out of appearing in [botDB](.), at any time and without any requiring explanation or further discussion, by contacting [the maintainers](#who-to-complain-to)**. We will endeavour to comply with any and all requests in relation any of the above **within 48 hours**.

## How to contribute

**2015-10-07: [botDB](.) is still very much ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️ and doesn't (yet) work as intended. Once it does, the following will apply, but for now hang tight, or [get in touch](#who-to-complain-to)!**

The simplest and most helpful thing is to **add entries to the database**! But be sure to have read up on [how to behave](#how-to-behave) first. You're encouraged to submit entries for yourself and your own bots, writing and tools, as well as for the work of others that you admire. This can be done using the Google Forms embedded at the top of each section, which effectively publish 'live' to the site. You're also encouraged (though not required) to sign your name (or alias, Twitter handle, etc.) to your submissions.

If you'd like to **make improvements to the site** itself, and you have a GitHub account, you're welcome to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the [botDB repo](https://github.com/tullyhansen/botDB/) – you'll [need Jekyll installed](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) if you want to run the site locally. Pull requests welcomed!
